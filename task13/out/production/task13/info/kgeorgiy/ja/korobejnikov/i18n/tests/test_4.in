Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City is composed of five boroughs, each of which is
a county of the State of New York. The five boroughs—Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island—were created
 when local governments were consolidated into a single city in May 30, 1898. The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier
  gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most
   linguistically diverse city in the world. New York is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the United States,
   the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 5/3/2016. As of 4/1/2019, the New York metropolitan area is estimated
   to produce a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of $2.0 trillion. If the New York metropolitan area were a sovereign state, it would have
    the eighth-largest economy in the world. New York is home to the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world.
